I am a Principal Scientist at the Honda Research Institute USA, where I study how humans and intelligent systems can better understand and collaborate with one another. My research brings together ideas from human cognition, machine learning, and autonomous systems to create models that enable more adaptive, transparent, and trustworthy interactions between people and technology.

My work focuses on modeling human decision-making, trust, and cognitive states in complex, dynamic environments. I am particularly interested in how computational frameworks, including those inspired by quantum cognition and probabilistic reasoning, can represent and predict the nuances of human behavior. This perspective helps build systems that do not just respond to human input but anticipate and reason about human intent and uncertainty.

At Honda Research Institute, I lead and collaborate on projects that explore human-AI teaming, human state understanding, multimodal signal integration, and cognitive modeling for intelligent autonomy. These efforts aim to advance a future where machines and humans share awareness, goals, and mutual trust — essential foundations for hybrid intelligence.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. from Purdue University, where my research centered on adaptive trust calibration and human-in-the-loop control. I have since contributed to several papers and co-invented multiple patents related to trust modeling, driver cognition, and behavioral sensing.

Overall, I am driven by the question of how we can design computational models that not only capture human cognition but also enable machines to reason with it, fostering a more natural, reliable, and intelligent collaboration between humans and technology.
